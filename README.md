# Hello, Hubot

Popexpert's hubot is a very special hubot, filled with puggy goodness and a very kind heart.

To access hubot (should he need a checkup) you can login to heroku with the following credentials:

Username: colby+hubot@popexpert.com
password: pophubot1020

Currently, hubot lives at popexpert-hubot.herokuapp.com. It's a nice little corner of the web, he likes it here.

Should you need to find a new home for hubot, he'll need a couple of housewarming presents:

HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT="popexpert"
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS="540358"
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN="2de90b63903770e825e30bb8fcae46a3ce13b981"

Should that token not work, you might have to set up a new account for him on campfire.



# Hubot

Hubot is a chat bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty
cool. He's extendable with
[community scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) and your own custom
scripts, and can work on [many different chat services](docs/adapters.md).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
